This project focuses on segmenting customers based on spending behavior using the Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset. By applying K-Means Clustering, we group customers into distinct segments based on features such as age, annual income, and spending score. This type of analysis is valuable for personalized marketing strategies and customer relationship management.
